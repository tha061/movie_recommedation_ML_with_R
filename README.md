# movie_recommedation_ML_with_R
The main goal of this machine learning project is to build a recommendation engine that recommends movies to users. 
This R project is designed to help you understand the functioning of how a recommendation system works. 
We will be developing an Item Based Collaborative Filter. 
By the end of this tutorial, you will gain experience of implementing your R, Data Science, and Machine learning skills in a real-life project.

Before moving ahead in this movie recommendation system project in ML, you need to know what recommendation system means. Read below to find the answer.

# What is a recommendation system?

A recommendation system provides suggestions to the users through a filtering process that is based on user preferences and browsing history. 
The information about the user is taken as an input. 
The information is taken from the input that is in the form of browsing data. 
This information reflects the prior usage of the product as well as the assigned ratings. 
A recommendation system is a platform that provides its users with various contents based on their preferences and likings. 
A recommendation system takes the information about the user as an input. The recommendation system is an implementation of the machine learning algorithms.

A recomendation system also finds a similarity between the different products. For instance, Netflix recommendation system provides you with the recommdations of the movies that are similar
to the ones that have been watched in the past.
There is a collaborative content filtering that provides you with the recommendations in respect with the other users who might have a similar viewing history or preferences.
There are two types of recommendation systems: content-based recommendation system and Collaborative filtering recommendation.

This project builds a recommendation system in R which based on collaborative filtering recommendation system, item based collaborative recommendation system
